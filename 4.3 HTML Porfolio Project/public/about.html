<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cesar Adrian Serrano, I am 22 years old and here are somethings to get to know me. I live in a home with my parents and
  2 brothers who love to compete against eachother. I currently am working a job that I don't realy enjoy much but it
helped me learn skills in the long run, like customer service and learning about vihicles. I am now trying to learning something
new, which is coding and trying build something out of that. Coding has fasinated me very much and is a hard journey but a great
one. I ca't wait to get a job and learn so much more in the area of coding. I have known to love technology ever since i was a
kid and wanted to learn so much more. For example how everything is built on the inside and out. When i learned about coding 
and what it could do, it blew me away. The fact that coding is everywhere like my phone, compututers, websites, and etc. When I
was a child i loved taking about my gaming sytems and laptops just to fix them or even clean them. I struggled a little in school
trying to figure out what i wanted to do in my life and now i really do know what I want to do. that is tryig to build my coding 
skills to show my parents I have what it take, that im not the dumb one in the family.</p>
